    <p>
      A <strong>Franzbrötchen</strong> (German pronunciation:
      [ˈfʁantsˌbʁøːtçɛn]) is a small, sweet pastry baked with butter and
      cinnamon, similar to a cinnamon roll. Sometimes other ingredients are used
      as well, such as chocolate or raisins. It is a type of pastry commonly
      found in northern Germany, especially Hamburg, and it is usually served
      for breakfast, but is also enjoyed along with coffee and cake. As its name
      indicates, the Franzbrötchen was probably inspired by French pastries.
